NWGUI
=====

This is a simple Graphical User Interface package that I'm developing for a 
simple 2d, top-down game I'm writing with pygame. 

My goals for this package are as follows:

* Don't make my game have to jump through a *lot* of hoops to get a working GUI.

* Don't make me rewrite my code base or use your event loop to add a GUI
  to my game.

* I would prefer to use some that someone is actually using in a game already.

I didn't find anything for pygame that met those goals (IMHO), so I wrote this.
